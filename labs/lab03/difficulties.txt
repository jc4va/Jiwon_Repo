 I believe that the implementations were not very difficult, but because I am not used to C++, it was difficult to make everything work in synchronization. For example, I was very confused by referencing pointers in the constructors rather than a stack variable. Also, I kept getting ‘linker error 86x architecture’ and ‘segmentation fault:11’ and I was very confused. I went to office hours and the TAs helped me to fix my code.
