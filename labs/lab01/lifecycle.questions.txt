  Name of the file: TestLifeCycle.cpp

1. Does everything in cpp file have to be functions that are directly related to the class in the header file? 
   For example, for lifecycle, does every function in lifecycle.cpp need to be                MyObject::something, and we include other functions that are not directly under the header file, for example cmpMyObj, in TestLifeCycle?

2. Is the relationship between lifecycle.cpp and lifecycle.h similar to that of interface in java?

3. I donâ€™t really understand the prototype
